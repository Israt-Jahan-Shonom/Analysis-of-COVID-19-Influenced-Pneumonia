# Analysis-of-COVID-19-Influenced-Pneumonia

This repository contains implementations of three fine-tuned residual networks (ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101) for the analysis of COVID-19 influenced pneumonia from chest X-ray images. This application are based on the study _["Improved Analysis of COVID-19 Influenced Pneumonia from the Chest X-Rays Using Fine-Tuned Residual Networks"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/9414567)_.
